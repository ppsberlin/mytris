# mytris
another tetris clone written January 2023

- game is playable on any ATARI 8 bit computer with at least 48kB of RAM
- stereo POKEY is supported
- Joy2B+ is supported
- music created by Buddy with RMT 1.34 and played back using an adaption of VinsCool's code (https://github.com/VinsCool/DUMB-Soundtest-LZSS)
- sfx created by PG and taken from sources above

This sources are not optimized, but they reassemble to same point, released v1.01 of myTris had. Mainly I just splitted 'mytris.asm' file into more files for better readability for other coders.
To rebuild, just use 'mytris.asm'. Project is working best with WUDSN IDE by JAC!, but should assemble fine with MADS alone, too.
